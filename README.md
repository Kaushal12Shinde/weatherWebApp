## Introduction

  The Weather App is a responsive web application that allows users to fetch weather details using the OpenWeatherMap API. 
  It provides real-time weather information for any city, as well as a five-day forecast. 
  The app includes features such as geolocation, saving favorite locations, and a responsive design that works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.

### Features

- **Geolocation:**
-       The app includes a geolocation button that fetches weather details for the user's current location.
        By clicking the button, the app retrieves the latitude and longitude coordinates of the user's device and makes an API request to display the weather information.

- **Save Favorite Locations:**
-     Users can save their favorite locations by clicking the save button.
-     The app stores the saved locations in the browser's local storage, allowing users to easily access them later without the need to search again.

- **Clear Saved List:**
-     The app provides a clear list button to remove all saved locations from the list.
-     Clicking the button clears the saved locations from the local storage and updates the display accordingly.

- **Search for City Name:**
-     Users can search for weather information by entering the name of a city in the search bar.
-     Upon submitting the search query, the app sends an API request to fetch the weather details for the specified city and displays the information on the screen.

- **Five-Day Forecast:**
-     In addition to the current weather details, the app also displays a five-day forecast for the searched city.
-     The forecast includes information such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions for each day.
